A GitHub Action to take Unity exported Xcode projects and automate the process of building, signing, archiving, notarizing, and uploading to Apple App Store Connect or Steam.

> [!NOTE]
> Steam uploads require an additional action step: [`upload-steam`](https://github.com/buildalon/upload-steam)

## How to use

### workflow

To archive, export, and upload directly to Apple App Store Connect, use the following workflow configuration:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: buildalon/unity-xcode-builder@v1
    id: xcode-build
    with:
      project-path: '/path/to/your/build/output/directory'
      app-store-connect-key: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY }}
      app-store-connect-key-id: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID }}
      app-store-connect-issuer-id: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID }}
      team-id: ${{ secrets.APPLE_TEAM_ID }}

  - run: |
      echo ${{ steps.xcode-build.outputs.executable }}
      ls -al ${{ steps.xcode-build.outputs.output-directory }}
```

### inputs

This action requires several secrets that need to be setup in the repository or organization's action secret store.

- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY`: The App Store Connect API AuthKey_*.p8 key encoded as base64 string.
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`: The App Store Connect API key id.
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`: The issuer ID of the App Store Connect API key.

> [!TIP]
> You can easily encode a file to base64 using the following command in linux, mac, or windows bash terminal:
>
> ```bash
> openssl base64 -in ./AuthKey_*.p8 -out ./AuthKey_*.txt
> ```
